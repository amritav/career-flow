# Technical Overview

This application is a React-based web application that runs in the user's web browser. It provides the following key features:

- **User Authentication**: Upon logging in, the application creates and stores tokens locally on the user's machine to maintain user sessions securely.

- **Access Control**: Authenticated users have access to multiple pages and features within the application, ensuring a personalized and controlled user experience.

- **Backend Server**: The application relies on a Flask server to serve various user requests. The server interacts with a MongoDB database to fetch and store data as needed, ensuring smooth functionality and data persistence.

With these components working together, the application delivers a secure and feature-rich experience to its users.

 # Getting started
 
Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Requirements:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (recommended >= 3.8)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Latest version 21.3 used as of 11/3)
* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Latest version 6.14.4 used as of 11/3)
* Docker

## With Docker
#### Running the entire application (Bring up the whole environment with Docker)
To start the application environment, run:
```
docker compose --profile all up
```
This will run all components required for the system. It will spwan up the backend component, frontend component, and the db component.
#### Shutdown:
```
docker compose --profile all down
```
This will stop and remove all active containers spawned up by the docker compose file
#### For UI development
```
docker compose --profile ui-dev down
```
This profile spawns up all components except the UI component. This simplifies local development where UI code can be quickly modified and run manually (```npm run start``` on the local machine) and the dependent components are managed by docker.
#### Local API development:
```
docker compose --profile api-dev down
```
This profile spawns up all components except the API component. This simplifies local development where API code can be quickly modified and run manually (```flask run``` on the local machine) and the dependent components are managed by docker. This requires a small change:
1. Add db_username env variable in your system with value localhost.

## Local Development
This is required if you are not using docker.
#### Setting up the Database:
1. Download [MongoDB Community Server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
2. Follow the [Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/)
3. In  ```app.py```  set  ```'host'```  string to  ```'localhost'```
4. Run the local database: 
``` 
mongod 
```
#### Starting the application
Run the startup.sh script (which starts the frontend with ```npm run start``` and backend with ```flask run```)
```
startup.sh
```
